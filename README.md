# Chapter 3

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for replicating Chapter 3 "Weak identification in nponparametric instrumental regression" of the Thesis "Estimation and Inference with Weak Instruments".

## Abstract

We provide a new characterisation of weak instruments in nonparametric instrumental regression (NPIV) and highlight the fundamental difference between this and the ill-posed inverse problem. Using this weak-IV sequence, we derive the rate of convergence of the integrated mean squared error (IMSE) of the Tikhonov and spectral cut-off estimators. Consistent estimation is possible if the instrument is "mildly'' weak and formalise this by defining the slowest rate of instrument localisation for which consistent estimation is impossible as the minimally impermissible rate of localisation (MIRL). The MIRL is jointly dependent on the smoothness of the structural function and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Theoretical results are supported by a Monte Carlo exercise. Estimators perform well with mildly weak instruments, and even when instruments are very weak, researchers can still learn important, economically-relevant information about the shape of the function of interest.
